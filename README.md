#What Open Source Means To Me

An experiment to see if we can get a bunch of people to send pull requests
about what open source means to them.  See CONTRIBUTING for the expected
format.

Open source means standing on the shoulders of giants, allowing humanity to
accelerate the pace of technological achievement collectively, instead of
wasting time starting from square one repeatedly.  Open source allows us to
examine, learn from, and understand how the software we use everyday works, and
how we can write better software ourselves.  Open source allows us to create a
community around users and contributors.  The opportunity of contribution is
allowed from any and all instead of exclusive rings of those employed by any
one organization.

Open source means that I have a computer with amazing software on it that's
available for free. I do almost all my work using Linux, Python, Ruby, Perl,
GNU tools. It means we have Wikipedia. I literally can't imagine a world
without open source software.

I also think about my experiences contributing to open source software, which
have been alternately amazing and super stressful. I've spent time in IRC channels
where people answer my questions within minutes and take me seriously, and
in channels where I've been mocked for not knowing things.

I think of open source communities as places that are useful and productive and 
supportive also as places where people can be rude and exclusionary and awful.
Building good communities isn't easy work, and open source isn't magical. We
can do so well and so badly.

El Open Source es importante para mí, porque me permite abrirme a un mundo mucho más amplio.
Aprender de los gigantes, poniendome a la par de los mismos en forma de pequeñas contribuciones.
El Open Source significa poner el avance primero. Permitiendo que cualquier persona pueda contribuir, en vez de competir.
El Open Source permite crear comunidades, lazos, permite que un completo desconocido ayude a otro. Que la necesidad de uno,
se convierta en el beneficio de todos.

Open source is important because software is changing the human history. And open source is a key part of that process.
A lot of human activity was leveraged by software applications. Even the Internet and the web are in part software.

And open source is important to me because is a way to learn, to practice, and to share with others. The way of doing
software is now: open source it. The way to learn programming is: read OS code, write OS code, collaborate with other OS project.

This way of doing programming is changing the metrics of the planet. Now, you and me can be connected, working together,
both living thousands of miles. The power is in your brain and fingers. Social position, previous education, welfare, does
not matter. The power returns to the people.
